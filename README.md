<!-- Presentation -->
Hello! My name is Davide and I am a 21-year-old Computer Science student at the Scuola Superiore of the University of Udine, in Italy. I consider myself a very curious person and I love both writing code and understanding the theory that makes things work the way they do. My current main interests include artificial intelligence, algorithms and quantum computing.

I am also really into music and I can play both the guitar and the piano, but in my free time I also love playing tennis and hiking in the mountains. Reach me out on my socials!
