Hey there! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Davide and I am a young computer scientist, software developer, and tech enthusiast. I consider myself a very curious person and I love both getting my hands dirty and understanding the theory that makes things work the way they do. My current main interests include embedded software development (especially using Rust), functional languages (Haskell, Nix), and quantum computing.

In my free time I'm currently trying to get healthier: I like hiking and climbing, but occasionally I also don't mind working out at the gym or playing some tennis. Oh, and I recently picked up running, too!
