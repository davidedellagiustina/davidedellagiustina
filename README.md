Hey there! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Davide and I am a young computer scientist, software developer, and tech enthusiast. I consider myself a very curious person and I love both getting my hands dirty and understanding the theory that makes things work the way they do. My current main interests include embedded software for automotive and aerospace, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.

In my free time I'm currently trying to get healthier: I like working out at the gym, hiking in the mountains and climbing, but occasionally I also like to play some tennis.
